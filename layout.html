        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>More Australians than ever are holding multiple jobs. This project visualises national and state-level data to show how multiple job-holding has evolved over time, and how it varies by gender and industry. The goal is to highlight key insights about Australia's changing workforce.</p>

        </script>
        <p>The rate remained relatively stable between 1994 and 2019, fluctuating around 5.5-6%, before a large decline in June 2020 caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. Since then, the rate has climbed notably.</p>

        <p>The map above shows the regional variation in job-holding rates across territories. In June 2025, the multiple job-holding rate was highest in Greater Hobart (capital city) and Tasmania (state) and lowest in Sydney and Queensland.</p>
